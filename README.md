SR-Plot Lite: A Streamlit-Powered Bioinformatics Tool for Biomarker Discovery and Survival Synergy Analysis

SR-Plot Lite is a web-based application designed to streamline the identification of biomarkers by comparing gene expression levels across clinical datasets. By leveraging ratio-based analysis, the tool allows users to uncover biologically coherent axes of disease that single-gene models might miss.

Key Features:

Ratio-based Biomarker Identification: Compare pairs of genes to identify diagnostic and prognostic ratios.

Survival Synergy Plots: Visualize the combined effect of multiple biomarkers on patient survival outcomes.

Interactive Visualizations: Generate publication-ready plots (Volcano plots, KM curves, and density distributions) directly in your browser.

User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for a fast, code-free experience for wet-lab biologists and bioinformaticians.
