🧬SR-PLOT: An Interactive Gene Ontology Enrichment and Visualization Web Application

SR-PLOT is a modern, web-based application designed to perform Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and present the results through interactive, publication-ready visualizations. The application focuses on transforming complex biological enrichment data into clear, interpretable plots, enabling users to explore functional patterns within gene sets efficiently.

Developed using React with TypeScript, SR-PLOT emphasizes performance, modularity, and scalability, while offering a smooth and intuitive user experience. The application is suitable for researchers, students, and bioinformatics enthusiasts working with gene lists derived from high-throughput experiments such as RNA-seq, microarray analysis, and functional genomics studies.

 Key Features
 Gene Ontology Enrichment Visualization

SR-PLOT supports visualization of enriched Gene Ontology terms across:

Biological Process (BP)

Molecular Function (MF)

Cellular Component (CC)

The enrichment results are structured to highlight statistically significant functional annotations and biological trends.

Interactive Plot Types

The application provides multiple interactive visualization modules, including:

GO Bar Plots for enrichment significance comparison

Gene-wise Bar Plots for expression or contribution overview

Pie Charts for proportional representation of GO categories

Heatmaps for pattern detection and clustering insights

Each plot component is modularly implemented, allowing smooth interaction and responsive updates.

Data Upload & Processing

Users can upload or input gene-related data through a dedicated data upload interface, which feeds directly into the visualization pipeline. This enables rapid exploration and iterative analysis without manual reconfiguration.

 Clean & Responsive UI

The application layout is designed for clarity and ease of use, featuring:

A structured page layout

Intuitive navigation between plot views

Responsive styling for consistent visualization across devices

Technology Stack

Frontend Framework: React

Language: TypeScript

Styling: CSS with PostCSS configuration

Visualization: Custom plot components built using JavaScript/TypeScript-based plotting logic

Backend / Hosting: Firebase (Hosting & configuration)

Architecture: Component-based modular design

This technology stack ensures type safety, maintainability, and scalability, making SR-PLOT suitable for future expansion.

 Design Philosophy & Motivation

Many Gene Ontology tools focus heavily on computation but lack interactive and user-friendly visualization. SR-PLOT was developed to address this gap by prioritizing:

Visual clarity over raw tabular output

Interactive exploration instead of static plots

Accessibility for users without advanced programming backgrounds

The goal is to allow users to focus on biological interpretation, not software complexity.

 Use Cases

Functional interpretation of differentially expressed genes

Exploratory analysis in genomics and transcriptomics projects

Academic demonstrations of GO enrichment concepts

Visualization support for reports, presentations, and publications

Future Enhancements

Integration of pathway analysis (KEGG, Reactome)

Support for multiple organisms and annotation sources

Export options for plots (PNG)

Advanced filtering and customization of visualization parameters

Optional backend integration for large-scale enrichment computation
